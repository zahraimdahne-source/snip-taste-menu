## 🚀 Two Ways to Complete Your APK

### Option 1: In Android Studio (Current - Recommended) ⭐

**You're already here!** Just wait for Gradle sync to finish, then:

1. **Wait** for "Gradle sync finished successfully" (bottom bar)
2. **Click** `Build` → `Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)` → `Build APK(s)`
3. **Wait** 1-2 minutes
4. **Click** "locate" in success notification
5. **Done!** APK at: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`

**Estimated time:** 5-15 minutes (mostly waiting for Gradle sync)

---

### Option 2: Automated Script (Alternative)

I've created **`build-apk-complete.bat`** that automates everything:

**To use:**

```bash
# Just double-click this file:
build-apk-complete.bat
```

**What it does:**

1. ✅ Builds your web app
2. ✅ Syncs with Android
3. ✅ Builds APK using Gradle
4. ✅ Opens folder with your APK
5. ✅ Shows success message

**Note:** This requires Gradle sync to have completed at least once in Android Studio.
